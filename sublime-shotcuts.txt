 Sublime Text 3 comes with its own Python interpreter that’s separate from your system’s Python interpreter (if available).
 The embedded interpreter is only intended to interact with the plugin API, not for general development


Command Palette
-------------------
Windows	ctrl + shift + p    /  Ctrl + ⇧ + P	Command prompt


 Just popup open the Command Palette and search for things like settings, options, syntax, and shortcuts. Most third-party packages that you'll install hook into this. One of the first things I do when I install a plugin is see what it added to the Command Palette. Some examples of things you can access are:
Settings
Changing Syntax
Snippets from Plugins
Actions from plugins (Git Commands, Block Comments, etc.)
